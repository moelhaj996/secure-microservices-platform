# Security Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the security architecture of our Secure Microservices Platform, detailing the implementation of Zero-Trust principles and security best practices.

## Security Layers

### 1. Network Security

#### Service Mesh (Istio)
- Mutual TLS (mTLS) encryption for all service-to-service communication
- Traffic encryption between services
- Automatic certificate rotation
- Network policy enforcement

#### Network Policies
```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```

### 2. Identity and Access Management

#### Service Identity
- Kubernetes service accounts
- Istio SPIFFE identity
- Automated certificate management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

#### Authentication Flow
1. Service initiates request
2. Istio sidecar validates identity
3. Policy check performed
4. Request authorized or denied

### 3. Secret Management (HashiCorp Vault)

#### Features
- Automated secret rotation
- Dynamic credentials
- Encryption as a service
- Audit logging

#### Integration
```hcl
path "secret/data/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list"]
}

path "auth/kubernetes/*" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list"]
}
```

### 4. Container Security

#### Runtime Security
- Read-only root filesystem
- Non-root users
- Resource limitations
- Security context constraints

#### Image Security
- Vulnerability scanning
- Image signing
- Allowed registries
- Base image verification

### 5. Monitoring and Detection

#### Security Monitoring
- Real-time threat detection
- Anomaly detection
- Compliance monitoring
- Access logging

#### Alert Configuration
```yaml
groups:
- name: SecurityAlerts
  rules:
  - alert: UnauthorizedAccess
    expr: rate(istio_requests_total{response_code="403"}[5m]) > 10
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      description: High rate of unauthorized access attempts
```

## Security Compliance

### Standards Compliance
- SOC 2
- ISO 27001
- GDPR
- HIPAA (where applicable)

### Audit Logging
- All access attempts logged
- Modification tracking
- Administrative actions recorded
- Compliance reporting

## Security Best Practices

### Development
- Secure coding guidelines
- Code review requirements
- Security testing integration
- Vulnerability management

### Operations
- Regular security updates
- Incident response procedures
- Backup and recovery
- Access review process

## Incident Response

### Process
1. Detection
2. Analysis
3. Containment
4. Eradication
5. Recovery
6. Lessons Learned

### Playbooks
- Security breach response
- Data leak procedure
- Service compromise
- Access violation
